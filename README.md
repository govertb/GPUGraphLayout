`graph_viewer` | GPU accelerated graph layout
=============================================

This repository contains experimental code for large scale graph layout using the GPU. Currently we only implement the basics of ForceAtlas2, a graph layout algorithm  designed for social network visualization in Gephi<sup>[1](#jacomy14),[2](#bastian09)</sup>. Our implementation of ForceAtlas2 is based on [the open source implementation](https://github.com/gephi/gephi/tree/6efb108718fa67d1055160f3a18b63edb4ca7be2/modules/LayoutPlugin/src/main/java/org/gephi/layout/plugin/forceAtlas2) used in Gephi itself, and considers the graph to be undirected. For force approximation, we use a CUDA implementation of the Barnes-Hut approximation algorithm<sup>[3](#barnes86)</sup> by Martin Burtscher and Keshav Pingali<sup>[4](#burtscher11)</sup>. This implementation is available as part of [LonstarGPU](http://iss.ices.utexas.edu/?p=projects/galois/lonestargpu). The average speedup, compared to a *de facto* CPU implementation of ForceAtlas2, is over 40x. This makes it feasible to compute layouts for networks with millions of nodes and edges.

#### System Requirements

A CUDA capable GPU. Currently only Linux is supported.

#### Obtaining all code
This repository contains a submodule (`lib/pngwriter`). Be sure to run
```
git submodule init && git submodule update
```
from the root of this Git repository before compiling. The code also depends on the `libpng` library (including its development headers). It should be possible to obtain this using the package manager for your Linux distribution.

#### Compiling
A `Makefile` is located in `builds/linux`. Running
```
make graph_viewer
```
from this directory compiles `graph_viewer` with CUDA support.
To compile without CUDA support, run `make graph_viewer CUDA_SUPPORT=0`.

#### Usage
`graph_viewer gpu|cpu max_iterations num_snaps sg|wg scale gravity exact|approximate edgelist_path out_path [png|csv|bin]`

`gpu|cpu`            : choose between a parallel GPU implementation or a serial CPU implementation.

`max_iterations`     : how many iterations of the layout algorithm to run

`num_snaps`          : choose how many times during the layout process a visualization should be rendered

`wg|sg`              : choose between weak gravity (inversely proportional to distance) or
                     strong gravity

`scale`              : scale repulsive force

`gravity`            : scale gravitational force

`exact|approximate`  : choose between the exact/pairwise O(|V|^2) repulsive force calculation or the O(|V|lg(|V|))
                     approximation using Barnes-Hut (GPU implementation only supports Barnes-Hut)

`edgelist_path`      : Text file (ascii) containing node IDs for each edge on a separate line (whitespace separated).
                       Lines starting with a `#`, the direction of edges, and self-loops are ignored.

`out_path`           : path to write resulting layout to

`[png|csv|bin]` is optional, defaulting to `png`, and determines the format of the layout written to `out_path`.
